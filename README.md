# CodeFlex
CodeFlex is a modern browser based coding platform that allows users to write, execute and share code in real time. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and powered by CodeMirror. It features robust multi language syntax highlighting, dynamic code templates, real time output validation, and an intuitive, responsive user interface. Designed for both learning and collaboration, CodeFlex streamlines the coding experience with built-in tools for code sharing, file downloads and theme customization.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔄 **Automatic Language-Based Code Download**  
  Downloads your code with the correct file extension (e.g., `.cpp` for C++, `.py` for Python) based on the selected language.

- 🌐 **Multi-language Syntax Highlighting**  
  Integrated CodeMirror for real-time syntax highlighting in multiple programming languages.

- 📄 **Dynamic Code Templates**  
  Automatically loads boilerplate code templates when a language is selected.

- 🧹 **Code Reset Button**  
  Quickly clears the editor and resets it to the default template.

- 🌓 **Dark & Light Mode Support**  
  Toggle between light and dark themes for a visually comfortable coding environment.

- 📥 **Input, Output & Expected Output Validation**  
  - Allows users to provide **custom input** and set an **expected output**.  
  - Displays a **"Matched"** message when the actual output matches the expected output.  
  - Shows **"Not Matched"** if the output differs — perfect for debugging.
